``` r
library(dplyr)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Describe the data: This dataset has 1,384,617 observations and 15
variables. In this dataset, each individual has a single order
demonstrating items they bought using Instacart. Some key variables are
reordered, which tells us how many times an individual reordered a
certain item, order_id, which identifies the order number related to the
data, product_id which can translate to which product they ordered, and
user_id which identifies which user’s data we are observing. For
example, in one row user 112108 ordered product 11109 under order_id 1
and had reordered it before.

Identify number of aisles and aisles with greatest number of ordered
items:

``` r
instacart_df = instacart |>
count(aisle)|>
arrange(desc(n))
```

Filter to aisles with over 10,000 items ordered and then create ggplot:

``` r
instacart_df_filtered = instacart_df |>
filter (n > 10000) |>
mutate (aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n))

ggplot(instacart_df_filtered, aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point () +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0.5))
```

![](p8105_hw3_mt3866_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Create a table of 3 most popular items in three aisles:

``` r
instacart_popular = instacart |>
  filter (aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  count(aisle, product_name)|>
  group_by(aisle)|>
  arrange(desc(n))|>
  slice_head(n=3)
```

Create a table describing mean hour of the day that Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream were ordered:

``` r
instacart_hour = instacart |>
  select (order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) |>
    filter (product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
    group_by (product_name, order_dow) |>
    summarize(mean_hour = mean (order_hour_of_day)) |>
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = order_dow,
      values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Bullet points (commenting on each): There are 134 aisles. The aisles
most ordered from are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged
vegetables fruits, and yogurt. The three most popular items purchased in
the aisle “baking ingredients” was light brown sugar (499), pure baking
soda (387), and cane sugar (336). The three most popular items purchased
in the aisle dog food care were snack sticks chicken & rice recipe dog
treats (30), organix chicken & brown rice recipe (28), and small dog
biscuits (26). The three most popular items ordered in packaged
vegetables fruits were organic baby spinach (9,784), organic raspberries
(5,546), and organic blueberries (4,966). The mean hour of Sunday in
which coffee ice cream was ordered was 13.8 and in which pink lady
apples were ordered was 13.4. The mean hour of Monday in which coffee
ice cream was ordered was 14.3 and in which pink lady apples were
ordered was 11.4. The mean hour of Tuesday in which coffee ice cream was
ordered was 15.4 and in which pink lady apples were ordered was 11.7.
The mean hour of Wednesday in which coffee ice cream was ordered was
15.3 and in which pink lady apples were ordered was 14.2. The mean hour
of Thursday in which coffee ice cream was ordered was 15.2 and in which
pink lady apples were ordered was 11.6. The mean hour of Friday in which
coffee ice cream was ordered was 12.3 and in which pink lady apples were
ordered was 12.8. The mean hour of Saturday in which coffee ice cream
was ordered was 13.8 and in which pink lady apples were ordered was
11.9.
