``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset has 1,384,617 observations and 15 variables. In this
dataset, each individual has a single order demonstrating items they
bought using Instacart. Some key variables are reordered, which tells us
how many times an individual reordered a certain item, order_id, which
identifies the order number related to the data, product_id which can
translate to which product they ordered, and user_id which identifies
which userâ€™s data we are observing. For example, in one row user 112108
ordered product 11109 under order_id 1 and had reordered it before.
