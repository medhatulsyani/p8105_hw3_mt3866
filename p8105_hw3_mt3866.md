``` r

library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Describe the data: This dataset has 1,384,617 observations and 15
variables. In this dataset, each individual has a single order
demonstrating items they bought using Instacart. Some key variables are
reordered, which tells us how many times an individual reordered a
certain item, order_id, which identifies the order number related to the
data, product_id which can translate to which product they ordered, and
user_id which identifies which user’s data we are observing. For
example, in one row user 112108 ordered product 11109 under order_id 1
and had reordered it before.

Identify number of aisles and aisles with greatest number of ordered
items:

``` r
instacart_df = instacart |>
count(aisle)|>
arrange(desc(n))
```

Filter to aisles with over 10,000 items ordered and then create ggplot:

``` r
instacart_df_filtered = instacart_df |>
filter (n > 10000)

ggplot(instacart_df_filtered, aes(x = n, y = aisle)) +
  geom_point ()
```

Bullet points: There are 134 aisles. The aisles most ordered from are
fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, and yogurt.
